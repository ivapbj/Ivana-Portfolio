Example Package Presentation Snippet

"I've designed three packages to help businesses like yours establish a strong online presence.

The Launchpad Package is perfect if you're just starting out and need a simple but professional website to attract customers.
The Growth Package is designed for growing businesses that need more functionality and want to optimize their site for search engines.
And the Elevate Package is for established businesses that need a premium website that can scale with them.
All packages include a mobile-responsive design, ensuring your website looks great on any device. I'm also happy to go over the options in more detail in a free consultation, where I can learn more about your needs and recommend the perfect fit for your business."

Key Points to Remember:

Flexibility: Be willing to adjust packages based on client needs.
Upselling: Use add-ons to increase revenue and provide more value.
Transparency: Explain exactly what is included in each package.
Test and Adapt: Review how clients respond to these packages. Adjust as needed.
Professionalism: Present your packages with a professional and polished look.
How This Package Supports Your Income Goal

This tiered system is designed to provide you with a way to meet or exceed your income target of $1000 per week. If you complete one higher-tier website per week or a combination of several smaller projects and maintenance, you should be able to achieve your goal.

By offering clear packages, demonstrating the value of your services, and having a structure for managing your time, you're setting yourself up for success.
